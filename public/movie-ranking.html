<h3>Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>Yes, they count as one. They are the best trilogy in the history of movies, no way to change my mind.</p>
<h3>Dune 2</h3>
<p>Watched it 3 times in the cinema, nuff said.</p>
<h3>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</h3>
<p>Cannot miss a good traumatising Disney movie on the list.</p>
